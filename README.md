The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets in data science and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.
Here’s a breakdown of what each column in the Titanic dataset typically means:

<b>PassengerId:</b>A unique identifier for each passenger in the dataset.

<b>Survived:</b> Indicates whether the passenger survived the disaster (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive).

<b>Pclass:</b> The class in which the passenger was traveling (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class). This is a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES).

<b>Name:</b> The full name of the passenger.

<b>Sex:</b> The gender of the passenger (male or female).

<b>Age:</b> The age of the passenger in years. Fractions indicate that the passenger is less than one year old. This column may have some missing values.

<b>SibSp:</b> The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
<ul>
    <li><b>Spouses:</b> Husbands and wives (mistresses and fiancés were ignored).</li>
    <li><b>Siblings:</b> Brothers, sisters, stepbrothers, stepsisters.</li>
</ul>

<b>Parch:</b> The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
<ul>
    <li><b>Parent:</b> Mother or father.</li>
    <li><b>Child:</b> Daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson. Some children traveled only with a nanny,therefore Parch = 0 for them.</li>
</ul>

 
<b>Ticket:</b> The ticket number for the passenger.

<b>Fare:</b> The amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket (in British pounds).

<b>Cabin:</b> The cabin number where the passenger stayed. This column may have some missing values.

<b>Embarked:</b> The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

These features can be used to build predictive models, for example, to estimate the likelihood of survival based on factors like age, gender, passenger class, etc.
